Data and file storage overview

Android uses a file system that's similar to disk-based file systems on other platforms. The system provides several options for you to save your app data:


1.App-specific storage:
Store files that are meant for your app's use only, either in dedicated directories within an internal storage volume or different dedicated directories within external storage. Use the directories within internal storage to save sensitive information that other apps shouldn't access.

2.Shared storage:
Store files that your app intends to share with other apps, including media, documents, and other files.

3.Preferences: 
Store private, primitive data in key-value pairs.

4.Databases:
Store structured data in a private database using the Room persistence library.
